<h1 class="text-center heading-lg">My Project Idea: Find A Teacher</h1>
    <div class="border-box">
        <h3 class="heading-md">Overview</h3>
        <p>Find A Teacher will be an app that is designed to help you or your children find someone willing to teach a subject that they are passionate about(for example teaching piano). The app would involve using location based technology to help students find teachers within their area or in a suitable time zone, students will be able to organize times that suits them best and chat with their teachers securely via the app. Both in person and video chat lessons would be available to increase the chance of success of the students in their desired learning needs.</p>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location services.</li>
            <li>Instant messaging.</li>
            <li>Forums.</li>
            <li>Video calls.</li>
            <li>Online booking.</li>
            <li>In-app payments.</li>
            <li>Teacher listings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading-md">Motivation</h3>
        <p>The motivation behind wanting to build this app is to improve the education and life skills of others around the globe, making it easier for people to locate a teacher instead of sifting through different websites, reviews, apps and other outlets for the perfect match to their learning needs. The app will also make it easier to find like minded individuals learning the same subjects as you and talk to them to help you both keep motivated towards your goal.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">Description</h3>
        <p>Find A Teacher is an application that will be available for use on windows, mac, android and iphone, via the internet or free downloadable app. The app works by allowing people who want to teach something to drop a pin on the map (while not revealing their address until the student has booked a in person lesson.) and they’ll be able to include the subjects what they wish to teach others, such as musical instruments, a forgein language, cooking etc. the teachers will also be required to write a description about their service, which would include how long they’ve been teaching, optionally a video showing of their skills, times they are available and any other information they wish to include.

        The potential students of these teachers would then use a search bar and location services to find their new teacher. After choosing which teacher they wish to go with the student will then be able to see a timetable of the available dates and times this teacher has available. After selecting the when and the how long of a session they wish to do with their teacher, The teacher will then receive a notification asking them to confirm if they accept to do the lesson. Once confirmed, the student will be prompted to pay securely via the app for the lesson.
            
        Students will also be allowed to leave detailed reviews of the teachers, things like a star rating from 1 to 5, a description of what the teaching experience was like, for example someone could leave a review that says “I have an excellent time learning guitar from john, he was well experienced and very patient with me and really helped me move in the right direction” they can also leave feedback to the teachers to help them improve if the student believes that they way they teach could use some work.
            
        The app would offer many different ways to teach with in person sessions and video sessions a possibility, you can connect with your teacher  no matter where you are in the world. The option to send your teacher questions via in app messaging, will allow you to keep connected between lessons. There are also forums available via the website for you to post questions, seek help and talk to other like minded individuals learning the same subjects as you, so if your teacher isn’t available you’ll be able to seek advice regardless.
            </p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>Requires either a computer or mobile device which has access to the internet and a good connection would be required for those doing video sessions. Other tools would depend on the subjects being learnt and what the teacher has available for students to use.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">Skills required</h3>
        <p>To create this app easily and smoothly, I believe and cross platform app development tool would be required, there are many options for this such as xamarin, react native, phone gap and ionic, but i believe the best platform would be react flutter, for a few reasons such as:
            Because using flutter reduces time and money spent developing an app by quickly looking native on both android and ios
            Uses the programming language dart, which is an easy language for developers to learn.
            Access to native features such as camera, which is required for phone sessions.
            Flutter also has the flutter app builder, which allows you to design the ui of your app for free.
            As i mentioned dart would be required to build this app, which is designed by google. Dart is a client optimized for apps on multiple platforms.
            </p>

        <h3 class="heading-md">Outcome</h3>
        <p>On successful outcome of this app, it will help people around the globe take their education and way of life to new heights learning many valuable skills and attributes. It would make it easier to find a teacher instead of searching through multiple websites, reviews, specialized apps or going around asking people you know. This app puts it all in one place to help increase the students chance of success, whatever that student is trying to succeed at in life.</p>
