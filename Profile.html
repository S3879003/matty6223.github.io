            <h3 class="heading-md">What do the test results mean to you?</h3>
            <p>The results of the tests mean to me that I am someone who loves to explore new ideas and problems, being guided by practical solutions rather than unrealistic ideals. Being a logical but creative thinker, can lead to some unique ways of figuring things out, which can be much sought after by teams looking for a refreshing take. I believe that these traits are all fantastic ones to have.</p>
    
            <h3 class="heading-md">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
            <p>I believe that based on my test results I can bring valuable attributes to a team, being able to analyse problems and reach imaginative solutions while also being open to others ideas and solutions to help create the best possible outcome. While also there are negatives based on the tests, my results show that I may be impatient with others who donâ€™t catch on as fast as I do and sometimes forget about others feelings when trying hard to complete an idea I'm passionate about, which can put team members in a position of feeling hurt or neglected.</p>
    
            <h3 class="heading-md">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
            <p>When Forming a team I should be careful to make sure to be patient with all members of the team and let them all have a chance of conveying ideas. Although I believe that being someone that comes up with creative solutions can be a valuable asset to any team.</p>
