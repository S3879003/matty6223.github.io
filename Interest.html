            <h3 class="heading-md">What is your interest in IT and When did your it start?</h3>
                <p>My Interest in IT started from a quite young age. I remember playing my ps1 and xbox with my brothers, among other consoles as I grew up.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-md">What really sparked your interest in IT?</h3>
                <p>I had learned to build my own computer setup in highschool with the help of my brother and ever since I've loved being involved with technology, I always keep updated with the newest technology coming out (graphics cards, cpu’s etc.).</p>

            <h3 class="heading-md">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
                <p>I chose to attend RMIT because I had heard really good things, and after seeing the course through open universities it was too hard to resist, being able to study while keeping my job at the hospital was exactly what i was after.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-md">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
                <p>I expect to learn life long skills that’ll help me as my career grows, I have messed around with the likes of html, css, javascript and python in the past before starting this degree and I hope to get a solid foundation in programming to help me achieve my dream career.</p>
